Module: SGChem

 Description:
  A set of routines for modelling gas-phase chemistry and cooling.
  Several chemical networks are currently implemented:

    Network 1  -- primordial chemistry (see Glover 2015a,b and refs. therein)
    Network 4  -- Simple H chemistry from Glover & Mac Low (2007)
    Network 5  -- Network 4 + approximate CO chemistry from Nelson & Langer (1997)
    Network 15 -- H, C, O network based on Glover & Mac Low (2007), Nelson & Langer (1999);
                  see Glover & Clark (2012) for a full description
